## Security Warnings (Pre-Existing)

⚠️ The following security warnings are pre-existing Supabase configuration issues (not related to this verification):

1. **Extension in Public Schema** - Extensions should be in separate schema
2. **Auth OTP Long Expiry** - OTP expiry exceeds recommended threshold
3. **Leaked Password Protection Disabled** - Should be enabled for production
