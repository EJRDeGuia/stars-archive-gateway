# Wi-Fi Restricted Access Implementation

## Overview
The STARS Archive Gateway now includes Wi-Fi restricted access functionality that limits thesis document access to specific authorized networks. This system includes both client-side and server-side validation, along with an admin-only testing bypass toggle.

## Features Implemented

### üõ°Ô∏è 1. Server-Side Network Verification
- **Edge Function**: `network-access-check` performs IP-based network validation
- **IP Range Checking**: Supports CIDR notation for authorized network ranges
- **Security-First**: Defaults to deny access if verification fails
- **Audit Logging**: All access attempts are logged for security monitoring

### üîß 2. Admin Testing Toggle
- **Role-Based Access**: Only admins and archivists can use the bypass toggle
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear UI showing when testing mode is active
- **Secure Implementation**: Cannot be bypassed by regular users

### üåê 3. Enhanced Network Checking
- **Real-Time Validation**: Network status checked every 5 minutes
- **Detailed Feedback**: Users see their IP and network type
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network check failures

### üé® 4. Improved User Experience
- **Clear Messages**: Informative error messages for access denials
- **Visual Status**: Color-coded indicators for network status
- **Testing Feedback**: Obvious indicators when in testing mode

## Configuration

### Authorized Networks
Edit `supabase/functions/network-access-check/index.ts` to configure:

```typescript
// IP Ranges (CIDR notation)
const AUTHORIZED_IP_RANGES = [
  '192.168.1.0/24',    // Local network range
  '10.0.0.0/16',       // Private network range
  '172.16.0.0/12',     // Another private range
  '203.124.56.0/24',   // Example public IP range for school
];

// Specific IPs
const AUTHORIZED_IPS = [
  '127.0.0.1',         // Localhost
  '::1',               // IPv6 localhost
  // Add specific IPs that should have access
];
```

### Testing Configuration
- **Admin Toggle**: Available only to users with 'admin' or 'archivist' roles
- **Local Storage**: Bypass setting stored in `localStorage` as `bypassNetworkCheck`
- **Auto-Refresh**: Page refreshes when toggle state changes

## Security Features

### üîí Server-Side Validation
- IP checking performed on Supabase Edge Function
- Cannot be bypassed by client-side modifications
- Audit logging for all access attempts
- Progressive security measures

### üõ°Ô∏è Access Control
- Admin-only testing toggle
- Role verification before allowing bypass
- Secure fallback to deny access

### üìä Monitoring & Logging
- All network access attempts logged
- IP addresses and user agents recorded
- Failed access attempts tracked
- Security alerts for suspicious activity

## User Experience

### ‚úÖ Authorized Network
- Seamless access to all thesis documents
- No restrictions or additional steps
- Full functionality available

### ‚ùå Unauthorized Network
- Clear error message with reason
- User's IP address displayed
- Instructions for getting access
- Contact information provided

### üß™ Testing Mode (Admin Only)
- Toggle button in bottom-right corner
- Visual indicators of bypass status
- Clear labeling as admin tool
- Secure role-based access

## API Endpoints

### Network Access Check
**Endpoint**: `supabase/functions/network-access-check`
**Method**: POST/GET
**Auth Required**: No

**Response**:
```json
{
  "allowed": true/false,
  "reason": "Access granted from authorized network",
  "networkType": "authorized|external|localhost",
  "clientIP": "192.168.1.100",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Client-Side Components
- `NetworkAccessChecker.tsx`: Main access control wrapper
- `TestingModeToggle.tsx`: Admin bypass toggle
- `networkAccess.ts`: Service for network status management

### Server-Side Functions
- `network-access-check/index.ts`: IP verification edge function
- Integrated with existing audit logging system
- CORS-enabled for web access

### Integration Points
- Wraps main application in `NetworkAccessChecker`
- Integrates with existing auth system
- Uses established role hierarchy
- Connects to audit logging system

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Normal Operation
1. Connect to authorized Wi-Fi network
2. Access should be granted automatically
3. Verify thesis documents load properly

### 2. Restricted Access
1. Connect to unauthorized network
2. Should see network restriction message
3. Verify no access to thesis documents

### 3. Admin Testing Toggle
1. Login as admin or archivist
2. Toggle should appear in bottom-right
3. Enable bypass and verify access works
4. Disable bypass and verify restriction returns

### 4. Security Validation
1. Regular users should not see toggle
2. Client-side bypass attempts should fail
3. Server-side validation should be enforced

## Maintenance

### Adding New Networks
1. Update `AUTHORIZED_IP_RANGES` in edge function
2. Deploy updated function
3. Test access from new networks

### Monitoring Access
1. Check audit logs for access patterns
2. Monitor failed access attempts
3. Review security alerts for anomalies

### Troubleshooting
1. Check user's actual IP address
2. Verify IP ranges are correctly configured
3. Test edge function directly
4. Review audit logs for errors

## Production Deployment
